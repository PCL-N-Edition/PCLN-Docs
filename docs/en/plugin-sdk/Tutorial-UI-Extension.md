# Tutorial UI Extension

> Applies to PCL N Plugin SDK 0.2.5 and PCL.Plugin v0.18.5.

This page is the English counterpart of the matching Chinese SDK guide. It documents the same contracts, examples, and compatibility requirements.

## Dynamic launcher-native PclUi pages

Use `PclUiService.RegisterDynamicPage` when a page must follow live state without exposing Avalonia controls. The returned `PclUiPageRegistration` can replace its `PclUiElement` content from any thread; the host redraws active page instances on its UI dispatcher. Use `InjectDynamic` for live slot contributions and keep `RegisterPage` / `Inject` for static content.

All user-facing strings must be `PclLocalizedString` values. Parameterized text stays localized with `new PclLocalizedString("status.address", "Address: {0}").Format(address)`.

## SDK 0.2.5 requirements

- Target .NET 10 and reference only public PCLN.Plugin packages.
- Provide both locales/zh-CN.json and locales/en-US.json through the localization resource path.
- Declare required and optional permissions explicitly and degrade gracefully when optional capabilities are unavailable.
- Keep the package manifest icon separate from the PNG, JPEG, or WebP market icon uploaded in the publisher workbench.
- Submit Chinese and English market name, summary, and description before review or publishing.

## Contract parity

JSON, C#, AXAML, signing, Testing Host, and publishing behavior are identical across languages. See the SDK source schemas and examples for copy-ready contracts.
