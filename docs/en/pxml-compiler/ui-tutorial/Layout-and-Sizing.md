# Layout and sizing

PCL.UI.Next Runtime computes PXML layout incrementally; it does not delegate its core Measure/Arrange contract to Avalonia.

## Row and Column

```xml
<Column Padding="20" Gap="12">
  <Text Text="Downloads" />
  <Row Gap="8" Align="Center">
    <Text Text="Current version" />
    <Button Text="Refresh" Command="{cmd Versions.Refresh}" />
  </Row>
</Column>
```

Column arranges along the vertical axis; Row uses the horizontal axis. `Gap` appears only between adjacent children, `Padding` is inside the container, and `Margin` is outside a node.

## Constraints

| Syntax | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Width="120"` | fixed logical pixels |
| `Width="50%"` | half the parent available width |
| `Width="auto"` | content measured under the parent constraint |
| `Width="1*"` | weighted remaining track space |
| `MinWidth` / `MaxWidth` | lower/upper measure bounds |

Percentage and star values resolve only after the parent provides an available constraint. Wrapped text therefore uses its actual allocated content width and remeasures when the viewport changes.

## Choosing a container

- Row/Column: one-dimensional content.
- Grid: two-dimensional fixed/auto/percentage/star tracks. Constrained star tracks redistribute space iteratively.
- Overlay: children share one layout region; it does not create a modal interaction barrier by itself.
- Absolute: local canvases and anchored decoration, not ordinary responsive pages.
- Scroll: small scrollable content.
- VirtualList: large dynamic collections; never precreate thousands of children in Scroll.

Grid track declarations are validated by the target UI profile's component schema. Do not treat an unregistered ad-hoc track string as portable syntax.

## Text wrapping

```xml
<Column Width="50%" Padding="12">
  <Text Text="{bind Article.Summary}" />
</Column>
```

Layout Measure passes the actual available content width to text shaping. Viewport shrink changes line count, desired height, and LayoutRect in the same layout convergence—never estimate height from character count.
